    <string name="rules">
        	\t The game starts with an 
       	\n empty game board. The game board 
       	\n consists of the four separate 
       	\n boards. The starting player 
       	\n places a marble in a socket  
       	\n if his or her choice. After 
       	\n placing a marble the player turns
        \n any one of the four boards one 
        \n notch (90 degrees) clock - or 
        \n counter clockwise. A board, not 
        \n necessarily the one on whitch the 
        \n marble been placed, must be 
        \n turned each move.
		\n \n
			\t Then the second player does 
		\n the same, i.e. places a marble 
		\n and turns a board. So on and 
		\n so forth.
		\n \n
			\t The first player to get five 
		\n marbles in a row wins! The row can 
		\n be horizontal, vertical or diagonal 
		\n and run over two or three boards. 
		\n If a player gets five in a row when 
		\n placing a marble he or she does not 
		\n need to turn a board. If all the 
		\n sockets have been filled without 
		\n any player getting five in a row the 
		\n game is draw. If both players get the 
		\n five in a row as a player turns a board 
		\n the game is also a draw.
